				<h1>The registration process for the proposed e-learning systems consists of two phases: filling the registration form and attempting a set of 15 questions.  Based on the score obtained, the user is allocated a homepage.

				The user just has to login using username and password in order to get access to his homepage.  We now describe some interesting parts of the system.

				<h2><p>The Certificate of Primary Education results determine the admission of the children into secondary schools.  There are two important examinations at the secondary level.  After successfully completing five years of study, the students sit for the School Certificate examination.  After passing the School Certificate examination, the students sit for the Higher School Certificate examination after studying for two additional years.  At colleges, a variety of subjects are taught.  From Form 1 up to Form 3, all subjects are compulsory.  The science subjects, Economics, Accounting, among others, are optional as from Form 4.
				Until recently, there has been a cut throat competition at primary level to secure a place in one of the few ‘star’ secondary schools.  As a result, the educational experience of the Mauritian children has been limited mostly to the academic subjects.
				As per the White Paper – Pre Primary & Secondary Education (n.d.), the present educational system is getting outdated.  We do acknowledge that it did help Mauritius to complete its first phase of industrialization. However, as per the White Paper, failure to reform the system may seriously endanger our social harmony.
				However, the figures are biased as they do not consider the dropouts before examinations.  Also certain private secondary schools apply some measure of pre-selection before the examinations, thus distorting the true figures.
