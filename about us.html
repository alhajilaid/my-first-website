      This integration has two basic elements complementing each other which reflect on the studentsâ€™ needs and this process necessitates both teachers and school principals. 
      Teachers are required to bring behavioral changes in the students. The teachers are expected to integrate their lessons with ICT in order to train the individuals of an information society. Thus, the teachers should have a sound knowledge of ICT.  The teacher should be trained if required.
